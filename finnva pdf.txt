The Most Interesting Thing I Learned About Finance This Week
This week, I was particularly intrigued by the concept of financial recursion—the idea that financial instruments can be built on top of each other in self-referential loops, sometimes leading to unexpected consequences. One example is synthetic assets, where financial products derive their value from other assets, which in turn may be backed by yet another layer of derivatives. This creates a complex web where risk and value become deeply intertwined.

A striking case of financial recursion was the 2008 financial crisis, where mortgage-backed securities (MBS) were repackaged into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), which were then further sliced into CDO-squared instruments. Each layer was treated as an independent asset, yet all depended on the same underlying mortgages. When those mortgages collapsed, the entire structure unraveled, amplifying the damage.

Applying this to my daily life in 2025, I realize how important it is to trace back the true source of value in financial decisions. Whether it's investing in DeFi yield farms, structured investment products, or even stock options, I need to ask: What is this really backed by? Many modern financial tools, like tokenized assets or leveraged ETFs, build on similar recursive principles, and while they offer high returns, they can also carry hidden risks.

Beyond investing, financial recursion teaches me a broader lesson about systems thinking—understanding how small, interconnected components can create massive ripple effects. Whether in finance, technology, or decision-making, I now see the importance of breaking down layers to uncover the true foundation of value before taking risks.
